# This file sets up include directories and link directories 
# for a project to use SuperElastix. It should not be
# included directly, but rather through the SUPERELASTIX_USE_FILE setting
# obtained from SimpleITKConfig.cmake.

# Add include directories needed to use SuperElastix
include_directories( ${SUPERELASTIX_INCLUDE_DIRS} )

# Add link directories needed to use SuperElastix
