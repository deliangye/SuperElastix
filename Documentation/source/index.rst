SuperElastix Documentation 
==========================

SuperElastix is the next iteration of the widely used elastix medical image registration library. The project is under active development at Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam (BIGR), Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands, and Laboratory for Clinical and Experimental Image Processing (LKEB), Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden.

At the moment the documentation mainly hosts information for SuperElastix developers. See the `elastix manual <http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/download/elastix_manual_v4.7.pdf>`_ for documentation on how to use elastix.
